            <h2>Pipes</h2>
            <p>
              Steel Pipes are grouped into two main categories: Seamless and
              Welded pipes in Carbon Steel, Alloy Steel & Stainless steel &
              Low-Temperature Steel Duplex. Seamless pipes are made of metal
              alloys that have carbon and iron as the basic composition. Carbon
              Steel Pipes have greater carrying capacity than pipes of other
              materials.

            <h2>Fittings</h2>
            <p>
              The fittings are the inevitable component that helps in changing
              the direction of the flow. Fittings are the detachable piece of
              pipes or tubes that may connect other pipes and tubes. Some
              fittings can change the size of the pipe and some can connect
              different components such as couplings and stop the flows.

            <h2>Fasteners</h2>
            <p>
              Fasteners are hardware devices that mechanically joins or affixes
              two or more objects together. In general, fasteners are used to
              create non-permanent joints; that is, joints that can be removed
              or dismantled without damaging the joining components. We should
              consider a variety of factors when selecting a fastener.

            <h2>Flanges</h2>
            <p>
              Flanges are the second most used joining method after the welding.
              Flanges are used when joints need dismantling. It Provides
              flexibility for maintenance. Flange Connects the pipe with various
              equipment and valves. Breakup flanges are added in the pipeline
              system if regular maintenance is required during plant operation.

            <h2>Valves</h2>
            <p>
              Valves are mechanical devices that control the flow and pressure
              within a system or process. They are essential components of a
              piping system that conveys liquids, gases, vapors, slurries etc.
              Different types of valves are available: gate, globe, plug, ball,
              butterfly, check, diaphragm, pinch, pressure relief, control
              valves etc.

            <h2>Gaskets & Packing</h2>
            <p>
              A gasket is a mechanical seal which fills the space between two or
              more mating surfaces, generally to prevent leakage from or into
              the joined objects while under compression. Gaskets allow for
              “less-than-perfect” mating surfaces on machine parts where they
              can fill irregularities.
